Specific Need - Schedule

User Story - Live in a rural town, recycling truck stays for the day and you
take your recycling to it. Would like to know when it is coming a day before
it is scheduled to show up.

As a recicling customer, I would like a notification on my phone that tells me when
the trash truck is coming.

Deliverable (In user story) - Give them a mobile app that displays days the truck will not be available.

I work in an office complex, the company sends different foods trucks on different
days. I don't like all of them so I can decide wether or not to pack a lunch today.

As an office worker,I would like an automated text message to let me know the schedule of the food truck for each week, so I know wether or not to pack a lunch.
