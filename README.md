# Practice
A repository to make programs from scratch, testing and trying new skills when coding.

I have been working on multiple code testing theories I have had and testing 
out code as well. The code I have made is not finised and I may not find the
time to finish it however I have learned valuable information from testing
theories and ideas in which I have coded.
